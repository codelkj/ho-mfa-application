PEER 2 ASSESSMENT
Submission Title: "Penetration Testing and Wireshark: An Analytical Examination"
Assessed by: Johnson Mabgwe
Date: October 14, 2025

================================================================================
ASSESSMENT CRITERIA AND GRADES
================================================================================

ASPECT 1: What is penetration testing?
Weight: 15%
Grade: 10 (Advanced)

Comment for Aspect 1:
Exceptional definition with critical distinction from vulnerability scanning: "Unlike a vulnerability scan...penetration test involves manual, human-driven process that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities to determine actual risk." Your explanation of both external and internal testing perspectives demonstrates comprehensive understanding. Well-cited with Engebretson (2013).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASPECT 2: What activities need to be performed to execute the Penetration Test?
Weight: 15%
Grade: 10 (Advanced)

Comment for Aspect 2:
Exemplary explanation distinguishing passive vs. active reconnaissance, static vs. dynamic analysis, and including specific tools (Nmap, Nessus). Your discussion of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) in the Maintaining Access phase demonstrates sophisticated cybersecurity knowledge. The comprehensive reporting section with remediation recommendations is excellent. Well-supported by Oriyano (2014).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASPECT 3: Explained the core features of Wireshark
Weight: 20%
Grade: 10 (Advanced - Detailed explanation)

Comment for Aspect 3:
Outstanding coverage of five features: Deep Inspection, Live Capture, Powerful Display Filters, VoIP Analysis, and Export Capabilities. Your integration of features with penetration testing phases (Reconnaissance, Scanning, Exploitation, Post-Exploitation) and specific examples (Traffic Analysis, Credential Harvesting, MitM Attacks) demonstrates mastery-level understanding of practical application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASPECT 4: Examined all the panes in Wireshark
Weight: 20%
Grade: 10 (Advanced - Detailed explanation)

Comment for Aspect 4:
Exceptional detail on all three panes with clear explanation of hierarchical protocol breakdown in the middle pane and hex/ASCII representation in the bottom pane. Your explanation demonstrates understanding of how analysts use each pane for different analytical purposes, not just what they display.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASPECT 5: Explained the main filters in Wireshark
Weight: 20%
Grade: 10 (Advanced - Detailed explanation)

Comment for Aspect 5:
Exemplary explanation with Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax mention and progression from simple to complex filters. Excellent examples: "tcp.port == 443 && ip.src == 10.0.0.5" (combination), "http.request.uri contains 'login'" (content), and "tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0" (TCP handshake analysis). Demonstrates mastery of both technical implementation and practical application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASPECT 6: Use of APA Guidelines
Weight: 10%
Grade: 10 (Advanced - No errors in formatting)

Comment for Aspect 6:
Perfect APA compliance! Flawless in-text citations, properly formatted reference list following APA 7th edition, credible peer-reviewed sources, and professional abstract. Your paper structure with clear headings enhances readability. Sets the standard for academic writing in cybersecurity coursework.
