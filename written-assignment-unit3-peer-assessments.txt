Good coverage of VirtualBox startup steps with platform-specific details for macOS. The explanation includes important security permission requirements unique to macOS, which adds practical value. The four-step process is clear and logical, covering application location, security permissions, program launch, and installation verification. However, the explanation could benefit from more detail about the VirtualBox Manager interface and initial configuration options.

ASPECT 3: Explained the steps to create the first virtual machine with screenshots
Grade: 9/10 (Advanced)

Comment for Aspect 3:
Comprehensive step-by-step VM creation process with excellent figure references (Figures 1-8). The explanation covers all essential steps from initial VM creation through Ubuntu installation completion. The ARM64-specific considerations are valuable, including ISO selection and compatibility requirements. The process documentation is thorough, showing practical experience with the actual installation. The inclusion of final desktop screenshot (Figure 8) effectively demonstrates successful completion.

ASPECT 4: Use of APA Guidelines
Grade: 8/10 (Proficient)

Comment for Aspect 4:
Good adherence to APA formatting with proper in-text citations and reference list. The paper structure follows academic standards with clear sections and professional presentation. Minor formatting inconsistencies in spacing and some reference formatting could be improved. The sources are relevant and properly cited, though expanding the reference base would strengthen the academic foundation.

OVERALL FEEDBACK:
This submission demonstrates strong practical understanding of virtualization and VirtualBox implementation, particularly valuable for ARM64/Apple Silicon environments. The hands-on experience is evident throughout, with specific technical details that would benefit other students facing similar platform challenges. The academic writing is solid with room for minor APA formatting improvements.
