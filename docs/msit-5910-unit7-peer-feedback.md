### Peer 1: Mouaz Hendi

**Rating: 9/10 (B - Good)**

Your discussion provides a strong and well-organized examination of verification and validation, clearly distinguishing between the two concepts and demonstrating solid understanding of their complementary roles in software quality assurance. I particularly appreciate how you frame verification as ensuring software is "built according to specified requirements" while validation confirms it "fulfills its intended use and satisfies user needs," which aligns perfectly with industry-standard definitions (Pressman & Maxim, 2020). Your systematic classification of V&V approaches into static verification techniques (requirements reviews, code inspections, static analysis) and dynamic validation techniques (unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing) provides clear conceptual organization that makes the material accessible. The concrete examples you provide, such as requirements review ensuring completeness before design and unit testing validating login function authentication, effectively demonstrate practical application of these concepts. However, your discussion would benefit from including quantitative metrics or comparative data showing V&V impact on project outcomes, similar to how industry research demonstrates cost-benefit ratios of early defect detection (Forsgren et al., 2023). Additionally, incorporating a real-world failure example, such as the 2024 CrowdStrike incident, would strengthen your argument about the consequences of inadequate validation.

### Peer 2: Sugito Haba

**Rating: 10/10 (A - Excellent)**

Your discussion delivers an exceptionally comprehensive and insightful examination of verification and validation that demonstrates mastery of both theoretical concepts and practical application. The systematic structure you employ, beginning with clear definitions and progressing through detailed analysis of static verification and dynamic validation approaches, creates a highly readable and professional presentation. I am particularly impressed by how you connect V&V to broader quality objectives, noting that these processes "reduce the likelihood of product failures and guarantee adherence to quality standards" while simultaneously addressing stakeholder communication and knowledge sharing benefits (BasuMallick, 2022). Your specific examples across different contexts, from e-commerce shopping cart verification to mobile application accessibility inspections and prototyping for early user feedback, demonstrate sophisticated understanding of how V&V practices adapt to different development scenarios. The inclusion of both formal techniques (design inspections, acceptance testing) and collaborative approaches (walkthroughs, prototyping) shows comprehensive coverage of the V&V toolkit. Your conclusion effectively reinforces the central thesis that verification ensures technical correctness while validation guarantees functional appropriateness, and that rigorous application of both processes throughout the development lifecycle is essential for delivering products that meet both technical standards and business objectives. This discussion exemplifies the depth of analysis and practical insight expected at the graduate level.

### Peer 3: Rithysak Sorn

**Rating: 9/10 (B - Good)**

Your discussion offers a refreshingly honest and reflective examination of how verification and validation evolved from theoretical concepts to practical necessities throughout your capstone project experience. I genuinely appreciate your candid admission that you initially focused on "whether my scripts and workflows were working" before realizing that "working code does not automatically mean good or usable software"—this insight captures a critical lesson that many developers learn through experience rather than textbooks. Your personal narrative, describing how scripts that "passed all technical checks" still produced outputs that "were not always practical or accurate enough," powerfully illustrates the verification-validation gap that Leary (2021) describes theoretically. The way you connect abstract V&V concepts to concrete practices you employed—version control for tracking changes, unit and integration testing for component verification, system-level testing with visual inspection for validation, and documentation for identifying gaps between planned and actual outcomes—demonstrates sophisticated understanding of how these processes work synergistically. Your reflective conclusion, emphasizing that "good software is not just about code that runs, but about systems that deliver meaningful results," shows the kind of professional maturity and disciplined thinking that will serve you well beyond this academic program. One suggestion for strengthening future discussions would be to include specific metrics or comparative data from your project showing measurable improvements resulting from V&V implementation.

### Peer 4: Amit Kumar Tiwari

**Rating: 10/10 (A - Excellent)**

Your discussion presents an exceptionally well-articulated and insightful analysis of verification and validation that effectively balances theoretical rigor with practical application. The framing of V&V as "dual assurance" mechanisms, where verification ensures "technical excellence" while validation ensures "business relevance," powerfully captures their complementary nature and directly addresses why both processes are non-negotiable in professional software development. I particularly appreciate your economic argument citing Boehm's research on defect remediation costs, noting that defects found during requirements analysis cost 1x to fix while production defects cost 100x—this quantitative perspective strengthens your case for front-loading quality assurance activities. Your classification of approaches into static verification techniques and dynamic validation techniques provides clear conceptual organization, and the specific examples you provide are exceptionally well-chosen: the code walkthrough catching an uncommitted database transaction demonstrates peer review effectiveness, the static analysis identifying deprecated functions shows automated tool value, and especially the UAT example where export functionality passed system tests but failed to meet actual business needs perfectly illustrates why validation cannot be replaced by verification alone (Leary, 2021). The way you connect verification and validation to version control and project reporting shows sophisticated understanding of how V&V activities integrate with broader software engineering practices. Your discussion successfully demonstrates that technically correct software can be functionally useless without proper validation, making a compelling case for why both processes must work together rather than in isolation.

## Summary

All four peers demonstrated solid understanding of verification and validation concepts, with varying approaches to presenting the material. Sugito and Amit provided the most comprehensive analyses with strong theoretical grounding and practical examples, earning 10/10 ratings. Mouaz delivered a well-structured technical discussion that would benefit from quantitative metrics (9/10). Rithysak offered an exceptional reflective narrative grounded in personal experience, though it could be strengthened with comparative data (9/10). Each contribution advanced the discussion in meaningful ways, demonstrating the diverse perspectives graduate students bring to software quality assurance topics.
