## Peer Response 1: Amit Kumar Tiwari

**Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)**

Amit, your discussion provides an exemplary reflection on the capstone development process with excellent structure and depth. I particularly appreciated your systematic breakdown of how the capstone enforced project management discipline, fostered an iterative mindset, and demanded integration of functional skills beyond just coding. Your point about functioning as "not just a coder, but also as a requirements analyst, a technical writer, a quality assurance tester, and a configuration manager" resonates deeply with my own experience on the HO-MFA project where wearing multiple hats was essential for success. The strength you demonstrated in system integration and technical depth, particularly in orchestrating disparate technologies into a seamless architecture, mirrors the challenges I faced implementing defense-in-depth security across six architectural layers. Your professional communication emphasis is spot-on—bridging the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders is indeed a vital skill that distinguishes good IT professionals from great ones.

## Peer Response 2: Tariku Lencho

**Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)**

Tariku, your reflection demonstrates exceptional depth and professional maturity in how you approached the capstone journey. Your insight that "decisions made during problem definition or requirements analysis did not remain confined to those early weeks; they shaped design options, testing complexity, and even how confidently I could defend my final solution" is profoundly accurate and reflects genuine systems thinking. I particularly value your emphasis on treating the SRS as more than just a document but as "a point of reference whenever scope questions or design trade-offs surfaced"—this is exactly the disciplined approach that differentiates professional software development from academic exercises. Your discussion of balancing architectural advantages (Dataverse) against licensing limitations (SharePoint lists) demonstrates the pragmatic decision-making required in real-world IT environments. Your question about which early decision had the biggest impact is thought-provoking; in my HO-MFA project, the early decision to implement multi-tenant architecture with Row-Level Security fundamentally shaped every subsequent architectural choice and ultimately delivered enterprise scalability that single-tenant designs cannot match.

## Peer Response 3: Asquith Ballah

**Rating: 9/10 (Excellent with minor opportunities)**

Asquith, your discussion provides a solid and well-structured reflection on the capstone development experience. I appreciate your clear articulation of how the capstone required "sustained focus, independent thinking, and accountability for decisions" throughout the process, which accurately captures the professional responsibility this project demands. Your emphasis on structured thinking and systems-focused decision-making as demonstrated strengths is particularly relevant for System Administrator roles where solutions must be both technically sound and operationally sustainable. The connection you draw between the capstone and real-world IT environments where "solutions must work within operational and organizational limits" reflects mature professional judgment. One area where your excellent discussion could be strengthened even further would be including specific examples from your capstone project—perhaps a particular technical challenge you overcame or a design decision that exemplified your systems-focused approach—which would add concrete evidence to your already strong conceptual framework.

## Peer Response 4: Sugito Haba

**Rating: 10/10 (Excellent)**

Sugito, your discussion represents exemplary scholarly rigor with comprehensive theoretical grounding and systematic analysis. The depth of academic references (14 citations from authoritative sources including Helle et al., 2006, Sommerville, 2016, and Evans, 2003) elevates this discussion to publication-quality work that other students should emulate. I particularly appreciate how you ground your reflection in learning theory, noting that knowledge construction occurs through "authentic, project-based activities" aligning with constructivist pedagogy (Hmelo-Silver, 2004). Your discussion of Domain-Driven Design principles and full-stack architectural patterns demonstrates sophisticated technical understanding beyond surface-level implementation details. The emphasis on user-centered design that balances "usability considerations with technical feasibility" resonates strongly with my HO-MFA experience where authentication security had to coexist with clinical workflow efficiency. Your conclusion correctly positions the capstone as "not merely a demonstration of accumulated knowledge, but rather the foundation for continued professional growth," capturing the transformative nature of this experience. This is an outstanding example of academic discourse in information technology.
