### Peer 1: Tariku Lencho
**Rating: 8/10 (B)**

**Comment:**
Tariku, your response demonstrates exceptional depth and practical insight, particularly your real-world examples from SharePoint and Power Platform modernization projects—the Dataverse licensing constraint scenario vividly illustrates how incomplete SRS documentation creates costly architectural pivots. Your seven-section SRS framework is comprehensive and actionable, and your connection between early problem domain definition and actionable requirements reflects mature systems thinking. However, the response significantly exceeds the 700-word maximum, which prevents a perfect score despite the outstanding content quality.

**Response to Follow-up Question:**
To answer your question about a requirement that, if clarified earlier, would have prevented delays: In my HO-MFA (Healthcare-Optimized Multi-Factor Authentication) capstone project, the "Break-Glass Emergency Access" requirement initially lacked specificity about audit trail granularity. Stakeholders assumed basic logging, but compliance officers later revealed that HIPAA requires capturing the specific patient records accessed during emergency override, not just the authentication event itself. Had this been clarified in the initial SRS, we would have designed the database schema and logging architecture differently from the start, avoiding a mid-development refactoring effort.

### Peer 2: Asquith Ballah
**Rating: 10/10 (A)**

**Comment:**
Asquith, your response exemplifies scholarly rigor with excellent integration of IEEE 29148 standards alongside practical health IT applications—the laboratory information system example with the 60-minute critical results delivery requirement demonstrates how non-functional requirements translate directly into testable acceptance criteria. Your three-pillar justification (single source of truth, downstream traceability, risk management) provides a compelling argument for SRS importance, and the patient self-registration kiosk example effectively illustrates how comprehensive requirements enable proactive planning for hardware, networking, and security considerations. The balance between theoretical foundations and domain-specific applications makes this an outstanding contribution to our discussion.

### Peer 3: Rithysak Sorn
**Rating: 9/10 (B)**

**Comment:**
Rithysak, your response provides a clear and well-organized explanation of SRS importance, particularly your emphasis on the document serving as a "single reference point" that prevents the "I thought you meant..." miscommunications that plague many projects. The learning platform example with specific functional requirements (user login, course browsing, quizzes, progress tracking) effectively illustrates how abstract concepts translate into concrete specifications. To strengthen future responses, consider incorporating additional external references beyond the four cited and including more domain-specific examples—for instance, how SRS requirements differ in regulated industries like healthcare or finance where compliance constraints add complexity to both functional and non-functional specifications.
