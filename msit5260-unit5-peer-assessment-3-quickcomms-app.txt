ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
================================================================================

ASPECT 1: QUALITY OF WRITING (Weight: 20%)
Grade: 8/10 (Proficient)

Comment:
The writing is generally clear and the reader can understand what the author is communicating. The document is well-organized with an introduction, three main sections, and a conclusion. Technical concepts are explained adequately, and the author demonstrates understanding of HCI principles. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for clarity and professionalism:

1. Some sentences are quite long and could be broken up for better readability (e.g., the sentence beginning "Therefore, I designed three types of roles..." contains multiple clauses that could be separated).
2. Minor formatting inconsistencies exist (e.g., "sign in" vs. "sign-in," "multi-factor" vs. "multifactor").
3. The phrase "the 5 key pages of the app" in Figure 1 caption should be "The five key pages" (numbers under 10 should be spelled out in formal academic writing).
4. Some abbreviations are introduced but not consistently used (e.g., "Margalla Innovations (MI)" and "Quick-Comms (QC)" are defined but then the full names are sometimes used later).

The content is informative and demonstrates good understanding of the design process. With minor editing for sentence structure and consistency, this would reach the "Advanced" level. The writing is definitely proficient with fewer than three significant errors, meeting the "Proficient" criteria well.

ASPECT 2: CITATIONS OF SOURCES (Weight: 15%)
Grade: 5/10 (Emerging Proficiency)

Comment:
The submission includes two sources in the reference list: Interaction Design Foundation (IDxF, n.d.) and USER EXPERIENCE/Just in Mind (2024). Both sources are cited in-text and appear in the reference list, meeting the minimum requirement of "at least two sources." However, there are several issues that prevent this from reaching the "Proficient" or "Advanced" levels:

1. APA formatting errors in the reference list:
   - "Interaction Design Foundation [IDxF]" should not include the abbreviation in brackets in the reference list; abbreviations are only used in-text
   - "USER EXPERIENCE [UX]" should be formatted as "User Experience" (not all caps) and the bracketed abbreviation should be removed
   - The publisher "Just in Mind" should be "Justinmind" (one word, as shown in the URL)
   - The retrieval date format "2024, October 6" should be "October 6, 2024"

2. Limited number of sources: While two sources meet the minimum requirement, the assignment encourages "at least two" sources, and more comprehensive research would strengthen the academic rigor. Comparable peer submissions included 4-5 sources.

3. The in-text citations are used appropriately to support design methodology, which is good practice.

For future submissions, I recommend consulting the UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC to ensure proper formatting, and incorporating additional scholarly sources to support design decisions (e.g., sources on organizational communication systems, role-based access control, or mobile-first design).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASPECT 3: CRITICAL THINKING (BRAINSTORMING PROCESS) (Weight: 30%)
Grade: 8/10 (Proficient)

Comment:
The work shows good examples of critical thinking about the brainstorming process with clear explanation of how the final design was chosen. The author demonstrates a user-centered design approach by first identifying user needs and then designing the application to meet those needs. Specific design decisions are explained with rationale:

• Three communication zones (My Org, My Teams, My People) address different communication needs
• Three role types (Junior, Mid-Level, Senior) reflect organizational hierarchy and authority levels
• My Profile section addresses productivity and accessibility through customizable settings
• Security considerations (sign-in/sign-out, multi-factor authentication) are incorporated

The author shows understanding of the relationship between user needs and interface design. However, the brainstorming section could be strengthened by:

1. Describing the actual brainstorming activities (e.g., Did you sketch multiple alternatives? Did you consider other navigation structures? What other designs were rejected and why?)
2. Providing more detail on the decision-making process (e.g., Why three zones instead of four or two? Why these specific role names?)
3. Discussing design alternatives that were considered but not selected
4. Explaining how you validated that your design addresses the identified user needs

The critical thinking is evident and the design rationale is clear, placing this solidly in the "Proficient" category. More detailed analysis of alternatives and explicit discussion of the iterative brainstorming process would elevate this to "Advanced."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ASPECT 4: OVERALL DESIGN AND STORYBOARDS (Weight: 35%)
Grade: 8/10 (Proficient)

Comment:
The overall design is clearly presented with good visual documentation. Figure 1 shows the five key pages of the application (login, My Org, My Teams, My People, My Profile), and the author provides detailed textual descriptions of each page's functionality. The storyboards (Figures 2-4) illustrate three concrete use cases with step-by-step visual progression showing how different user roles interact with the system.

Strengths:
• Clear presentation of the main interface structure with five distinct pages
• Good use of visual storyboards showing user progression through tasks
• Each use case is tied to a specific user role (John/CEO, Amanda/Manager, Jacob/Junior)
• The storyboards show the interface at important points in each task
• Functional descriptions explain what users can do on each page

Areas for improvement:
• The wireframes could include more detail on specific UI elements (e.g., button labels, menu structures, dialog boxes)
• Figure 1 shows the pages but could benefit from annotations or callouts identifying specific interface components
• The storyboards effectively show navigation flow but could include more detail on intermediate screens (e.g., what does the "Record Video" interface look like in Use Case 1?)
• Consider including a menu tree or navigation diagram showing how all pages connect
• Some dialog boxes are mentioned (e.g., login dialog) but not shown in detail

The submission presents "sketches of important windows, dialog boxes, and menu trees, and briefly explains the function of each item" and "presents most Concrete Use Cases in storyboard form, includes sketches to illustrate how interface looks at most important points in the task," which aligns well with the "Proficient" criteria. Additional detail on UI components and intermediate screens would move this toward "Advanced."

OVERALL FEEDBACK
================================================================================

This is a solid submission that demonstrates good understanding of user-centered design principles and organizational communication needs. Your Quick-Comms application addresses real workplace communication challenges by providing separate zones for different types of interactions (organization-wide, team-based, and peer-to-peer). The role-based access control (Junior, Mid-Level, Senior) is a thoughtful design decision that reflects organizational hierarchy.

Particular strengths include:
• Clear identification of user needs driving design decisions
• Well-organized presentation with logical flow from brainstorming to design to storyboards
• Good use of visual storyboards showing different user roles interacting with the system
• Thoughtful consideration of security features (authentication, session management)
• Practical design addressing real organizational communication challenges
• Clear connection between use cases and interface design

Recommendations for improvement:
• Enhance APA citation formatting (consult UoPeople APA Tutorials in LRC)
• Include additional scholarly sources to strengthen academic rigor (aim for 4-5 sources)
• Expand the brainstorming section to discuss design alternatives considered and rejected
• Add more detail to wireframes showing specific UI elements (buttons, menus, input fields)
• Include intermediate screens in storyboards (e.g., the video recording interface, team creation form)
• Consider adding a navigation diagram or menu tree showing how all pages interconnect
• Proofread for minor formatting and consistency issues

Your work demonstrates practical thinking about organizational communication tools and shows good application of HCI principles. The Quick-Comms concept is well-conceived and addresses genuine workplace needs. With attention to the areas mentioned above, particularly citation formatting and visual detail, your future submissions will reach the highest level. Good work!

Total Score: 29/40 (72.5%)

Note: This score reflects strong conceptual work with room for improvement in citation practices and visual documentation detail. Your design thinking is sound—focus on strengthening the academic presentation and visual communication aspects.
