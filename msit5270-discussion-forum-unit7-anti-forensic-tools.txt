ANTI-FORENSIC TOOLS: TIMESTOMP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Description of Timestomp

Timestomp is a sophisticated anti-forensic tool designed to manipulate file system timestamps, specifically targeting the Master File Table (MFT) attributes in Windows NTFS file systems (MITRE ATT&CK, 2024). The tool modifies four critical temporal attributes: creation time (MACB - Modified, Accessed, Changed, Birth), modification time, access time, and change time, effectively obscuring the chronological sequence of file operations on a system (Wise Forensics, 2024). Originally developed as part of the Metasploit Framework's Meterpreter payload, Timestomp operates by directly altering both the $STANDARD_INFORMATION ($SI) and $FILE_NAME ($FN) attributes within the NTFS MFT, making malicious files appear legitimate by blending their timestamps with those of system files (MITRE ATT&CK, 2024).

The tool's functionality extends beyond simple timestamp modification. Advanced implementations employ "double timestomping" techniques that simultaneously alter both $SI and $FN attributes to evade detection mechanisms that identify discrepancies between these two timestamp sources (MITRE ATT&CK, 2024). In my experience as a Healthcare IT Security Analyst, I have encountered timestomping during incident response investigations where attackers attempted to conceal ransomware deployment timelines by backdating malicious executable timestamps to match legitimate system files, complicating our forensic timeline reconstruction efforts.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Timestomp

Timestomp presents several advantages from an attacker's perspective, which paradoxically inform defensive cybersecurity strategies. First, it effectively disrupts timeline-based forensic analysis by creating temporal inconsistencies that complicate incident reconstruction (Insider Threat Matrix, 2024). Second, the tool enables attackers to evade automated detection systems that rely on temporal anomaly detection, such as identifying recently created files in system directories. Third, Timestomp can be executed with minimal system privileges, requiring only user-level access to modify $SI attributes, making it accessible to less sophisticated threat actors (MITRE ATT&CK, 2024).

However, Timestomp has significant disadvantages and limitations that forensic investigators can exploit. Most critically, NTFS journaling mechanisms ($LogFile and $UsnJrnl) maintain immutable records of original file system operations, allowing skilled forensic analysts to recover authentic timestamps even after manipulation (Wise Forensics, 2024). Additionally, timestomping creates detectable artifacts: discrepancies between $SI and $FN attributes serve as red flags for forensic examination, and the tool itself may leave traces in system logs, memory dumps, or prefetch files. Furthermore, timestomping does not affect external logging systems, network traffic captures, or cloud-based audit trails, which maintain independent temporal records that can contradict manipulated local timestamps.

Why I Selected Timestomp Over Other Anti-Forensic Tools

I selected Timestomp for this analysis over other anti-forensic tools such as BleachBit, CCleaner, or secure deletion utilities for three compelling reasons. First, Timestomp represents a fundamentally different anti-forensic approach—obfuscation rather than destruction. While tools like BleachBit permanently delete evidence through secure wiping (CodeTester, 2025), Timestomp manipulates temporal context without destroying data, presenting unique investigative challenges that align with my professional focus on incident response and forensic analysis in healthcare environments.

Second, timestomping attacks are increasingly prevalent in advanced persistent threat (APT) campaigns and ransomware operations, making understanding this technique critical for modern cybersecurity professionals. The MITRE ATT&CK framework categorizes timestomping as Technique T1070.006 under "Indicator Removal," highlighting its significance in real-world attack scenarios (MITRE ATT&CK, 2024). In healthcare IT security, where maintaining accurate audit trails is essential for HIPAA compliance and forensic investigations, understanding timestamp manipulation techniques is paramount.

Third, Timestomp exemplifies the cat-and-mouse dynamic between attackers and defenders in digital forensics. While the tool can manipulate visible timestamps, NTFS journaling and advanced forensic techniques can recover original temporal data, demonstrating that anti-forensic measures are not absolute (Wise Forensics, 2024). This reality reinforces the importance of defense-in-depth strategies, including comprehensive logging, write-once storage for critical audit data, and multi-layered forensic capabilities that extend beyond file system metadata analysis.

Understanding Timestomp has enhanced my approach to forensic readiness in healthcare IT environments, where I now implement enhanced monitoring for timestamp anomalies, maintain immutable audit logs in SIEM systems, and conduct regular forensic timeline validation exercises to ensure our incident response capabilities can withstand anti-forensic techniques.
