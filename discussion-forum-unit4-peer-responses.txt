PEER RESPONSE 1: Response to Maksim Davidiuk

Hello Maksim,

Thank you for your concise overview of DNS security risks. Your identification of DNS spoofing, DNS leaks, DNS hijacking, and DDoS attacks covers critical vulnerabilities that organizations face daily. I particularly appreciate your mention of DoH (DNS over HTTPS) certification as a countermeasure, as this aligns with emerging best practices in the field.

From my experience in healthcare IT security, I'd like to expand on your point about IPv6 as a potential solution. While IPv6's larger address space does provide unique identification for devices, it's important to note that IPv6 alone doesn't inherently prevent DNS attacks. In fact, IPv6 introduces its own security considerations, including neighbor discovery protocol vulnerabilities and the challenge of managing vastly expanded address spaces (Hogg & Vyncke, 2024). In our healthcare environment, we've found that combining IPv6 deployment with DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) and implementing Response Rate Limiting (RRL) provides more comprehensive protection against the attacks you mentioned.

I'm curious about your practical experience with DoH implementation. Have you encountered any challenges with DoH deployment in enterprise environments, particularly regarding visibility and monitoring of DNS traffic for security purposes? In regulated industries like healthcare, we've found that while DoH enhances privacy, it can complicate threat detection and compliance monitoring efforts.

Your point about DNS leaks is particularly relevant in today's remote work environment. Could you elaborate on specific tools or techniques you've used to detect and prevent DNS leaks, especially in VPN configurations?

Overall, your post provides a solid foundation for understanding DNS security risks. I'd encourage you to explore the technical mechanisms behind these attacks in greater depth and consider how different countermeasures interact to create defense-in-depth strategies.

Best regards,
Johnson Mabgwe

Hello Carlos,

Your comprehensive analysis of DNS security risks demonstrates exceptional depth and professional presentation. The structured approach with clear introduction, detailed risk analysis, mitigation strategies, and conclusion makes your post highly accessible and informative. Your coverage of DNS spoofing/cache poisoning, DDoS attacks, DNS hijacking, and man-in-the-middle attacks provides a thorough examination of the DNS threat landscape.

I particularly appreciate your detailed explanation of DNSSEC and its role in verifying DNS data through digital signatures. In my healthcare IT security practice, we've implemented DNSSEC across our critical infrastructure, and your description accurately captures both its importance and mechanism. Your mention of DNS over HTTPS (DoH) and DNS over TLS (DoT) as secure communication protocols is especially timely, as these technologies are becoming increasingly critical for protecting patient data privacy in healthcare environments where DNS queries might inadvertently leak sensitive information about medical services being accessed.

Your discussion of man-in-the-middle attacks on DNS resonates strongly with real-world scenarios I've encountered. In 2023, our organization detected a sophisticated MitM attack targeting DNS communications in our guest network, which could have compromised patient portal access. The incident reinforced the importance of your recommendation for encrypted DNS protocols and network segmentation strategies.

One area I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on is the operational challenges of implementing DNSSEC at scale. While DNSSEC provides robust security, organizations often face challenges with key management, zone signing complexity, and the potential for service disruption if not properly configured. Have you encountered these challenges in your experience, and what strategies have you found effective for managing DNSSEC deployment complexity?

Additionally, your mention of DNS logging practices is crucial. In regulated environments like healthcare, DNS logs have proven invaluable for forensic analysis and compliance auditing. Could you expand on specific DNS logging metrics or patterns that you've found most useful for detecting anomalous behavior or potential security incidents?

Your post sets an excellent standard for technical analysis combined with practical security recommendations. The integration of current references (Neagu, 2024; Volovnik, 2025) demonstrates strong research practices and ensures your analysis reflects the current threat landscape.

Excellent work!

Hello Gabriel,

Your exceptionally thorough analysis of DNS security risks represents outstanding scholarship and practical understanding of DNS vulnerabilities. The depth of your technical explanations, combined with clear analogies and comprehensive countermeasures, makes complex concepts accessible while maintaining technical accuracy. Your coverage of DNS spoofing, DNS hijacking, DNS tunneling, and DNS DDoS/amplification attacks demonstrates mastery of the subject matter.

Your explanation of DNS tunneling particularly resonates with my professional experience in healthcare IT security. DNS tunneling represents one of the most insidious threats because it exploits the implicit trust organizations place in DNS traffic. In 2024, our security operations center detected a DNS tunneling attempt where an attacker was exfiltrating patient database queries through encoded DNS requests to an external command-and-control server. The attack was sophisticated enough to evade our initial intrusion detection systems precisely because, as you noted, it blended malicious traffic with legitimate DNS queries. Your recommendation for monitoring DNS traffic for unusual patterns—such as domains with long or strange labels and abnormally high query volumes—directly reflects the detection methodology we implemented following that incident.

Your analogy of the doorway for explaining DDoS attacks is brilliant and effectively communicates the concept to both technical and non-technical audiences. In healthcare environments, where DNS availability directly impacts patient care systems, DDoS mitigation is not just a technical concern but a patient safety issue. We've implemented the anycast DNS architecture you mentioned, distributing our DNS infrastructure across multiple geographic locations to eliminate single points of failure.

I'm particularly impressed by your comprehensive reference list (Akiwate et al., 2022; CISA, 2019; Gupta, 2019; Hinchliffe, 2019; UoPeople, 2025), which demonstrates extensive research and engagement with both academic and authoritative government sources. The inclusion of the ACM Internet Measurement Conference paper on DNS infrastructure hijacking shows engagement with cutting-edge research in the field.

One question I'd like to explore further: In your research on DNS amplification attacks, did you encounter information about the effectiveness of BCP 38 (Best Current Practice 38) implementation for preventing IP spoofing at the network edge? In our infrastructure, implementing ingress and egress filtering based on BCP 38 has significantly reduced our exposure to being used as an amplification vector, but adoption remains inconsistent across internet service providers.

Additionally, regarding your point about DNS tunneling detection, have you explored machine learning approaches for identifying DNS tunneling patterns? Recent research suggests that ML models trained on DNS query characteristics (query length, entropy, query frequency) can achieve high detection rates while minimizing false positives (Nadler et al., 2023).

Your post exemplifies the standard of academic excellence and practical applicability that makes cybersecurity education valuable. The integration of technical depth, clear communication, and actionable recommendations creates a resource that extends beyond the assignment requirements.

Outstanding work!
