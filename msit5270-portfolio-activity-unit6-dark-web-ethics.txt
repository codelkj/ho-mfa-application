Portfolio Activity Unit 6: Ethical Implications of the Dark Web

Ethical Implications of Dark Web Crimes and Hosting Considerations

Introduction

The dark web represents a paradoxical digital frontier where technological innovation enabling privacy and free expression coexists with criminal exploitation and data misuse. As technology permeates every aspect of modern life, the ethical ramifications of dark web activities—particularly crimes involving personal data misuse and the hosting of anonymous content—demand rigorous examination. This report explores specific cases of criminal data exploitation on the dark web and analyzes the technical and ethical dimensions of hosting websites within this clandestine environment.

Task 1: Ethical Implications of Dark Web Crimes Involving Personal Data

The Scale and Nature of Dark Web Data Exploitation

The year 2024 witnessed unprecedented levels of data breaches, with the global average cost reaching $4.88 million, representing a 10% increase from the previous year (Keepnet Labs, 2025). The United States alone experienced 3,158 data compromises in 2024, with a staggering 211% year-over-year increase in victim notices due to several mega-breaches affecting millions of individuals (StrongDM, 2025). These breached datasets frequently surface on dark web marketplaces, where cybercriminals trade stolen personal information including emails, passwords, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and medical records (Help Net Security, 2025).

Specific Case Studies of Dark Web Data Misuse

The AT&T data breach of 2024 exemplifies the direct pipeline from corporate security failures to dark web exploitation. A significant dataset containing personal information of millions of customers appeared on dark web marketplaces, where threat actors purchased and weaponized this data for identity theft, financial fraud, and targeted phishing campaigns (Help Net Security, 2025). The breach demonstrated how telecommunications infrastructure vulnerabilities, often exploited using stolen credentials found on dark web marketplaces, create cascading security failures that compromise entire customer bases.

The UnitedHealth Group ransomware attack represents an even more severe case, compromising data of over 100 million individuals in what became one of the largest healthcare data breaches in history (Keepnet Labs, 2025). The attackers not only encrypted critical healthcare systems but also exfiltrated massive volumes of protected health information (PHI), threatening to release sensitive medical records on dark web forums unless ransom demands were met. This case illustrates the dual-threat model increasingly common in dark web criminal operations: immediate operational disruption combined with long-term data exploitation.

Perhaps most alarming was the National Public Data breach confirmed in August 2024, which compromised sensitive information for nearly all Americans (Keepnet Labs, 2025). The scale of this breach—affecting approximately 330 million individuals—created an unprecedented dark web marketplace opportunity, with complete identity profiles available for purchase at scale. The ethical implications extend beyond individual privacy violations to systemic threats to national security, financial stability, and social trust.

Ethical Analysis of Dark Web Criminal Activity

The criminal misuse of personal data on the dark web raises profound ethical questions across multiple dimensions. From a consequentialist perspective, the harms are clear and quantifiable: financial losses totaling billions of dollars annually, psychological trauma for victims of identity theft, and erosion of trust in digital systems that underpin modern society (ResearchGate, 2024). The 2024 Gartner statistic indicating that 95% of security breaches result from misconfiguration rather than sophisticated attacks underscores the preventable nature of much dark web criminal activity, adding moral culpability to organizational negligence.

Tritle (2021) argues that the dark web presents a fundamental tension between privacy rights and security imperatives, noting that "the anonymous nature of the system allows for journalists and freedom fighters in countries that have heavy censorship laws and internet monitoring to reach out to supporters" while simultaneously providing "a method to cover up illicit internet activities or to acquire illegal substances or materials." This duality complicates ethical analysis, as the same technological features enabling legitimate privacy protection also facilitate criminal exploitation.

The deontological perspective emphasizes the violation of fundamental rights inherent in dark web data crimes. Victims of data breaches did not consent to having their personal information stolen, sold, and exploited. The categorical imperative would condemn such actions as treating individuals merely as means to criminal profit rather than as ends in themselves. Furthermore, the asymmetric power dynamics—where sophisticated criminal organizations exploit vulnerable individuals who lack technical knowledge to protect themselves—violate principles of fairness and justice.

From a virtue ethics standpoint, dark web criminal activity represents a failure of character at both individual and institutional levels. Organizations that inadequately protect customer data demonstrate negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. Criminals who exploit stolen data exhibit greed, callousness, and disregard for human dignity. The broader ecosystem that enables such activity—including cryptocurrency exchanges that facilitate money laundering and hosting providers that turn a blind eye to criminal content—demonstrates complicity through inaction.

Task 2: Technical and Ethical Considerations of Hosting on the Dark Web

Technical Architecture of Tor Hidden Services

Hosting websites on the dark web, primarily through Tor's onion services, involves sophisticated technical mechanisms designed to protect both service operators and users. The Tor network provides enhanced privacy safeguards including improved anonymity, end-to-end encryption, censorship resistance, and built-in protections against denial-of-service attacks (Tor Project, 2024). Communication through onion services occurs entirely within the Tor network, providing excellent metadata elimination and privacy safeguards that prevent even network observers from determining who is communicating with whom.

The technical process of hosting an onion service involves generating a cryptographic key pair that produces a unique .onion address—a 56-character string derived from the service's public key. The service operator configures their web server to listen on localhost and uses Tor software to publish the service descriptor to the distributed hash table maintained by Tor directory servers. When users access the onion service, they establish a circuit through the Tor network to a rendezvous point, where the user's circuit and the service's circuit meet without either party learning the other's network location (Tor Project, 2024).

Recent research from 2024 and 2025 has focused on both enhancing and attacking onion service security. Studies on deanonymization attacks demonstrate that sophisticated adversaries with sufficient network visibility can potentially correlate traffic patterns to identify service operators (Tor Project, 2025). Conversely, efforts to optimize Onionbalance—a load balancing system for onion services—aim to improve scalability and security by distributing services across multiple backend servers (Tor Project, 2025). A 2024 attack exploiting vulnerabilities in Tor's Hidden Service Directories was successfully mitigated in subsequent software updates, demonstrating the ongoing security evolution of the platform.

Ethical Considerations in Dark Web Hosting

The ethical dimensions of hosting content on the dark web present complex challenges that resist simple categorization. Tritle (2021) articulates this tension effectively, noting that while "the general perception of the dark web remains murky and unfavorable," with many believing "we would be better off shutting the dark web down," such actions would eliminate crucial platforms for "journalists and freedom fighters in countries that have heavy censorship laws and internet monitoring."

From a positive ethical perspective, dark web hosting enables several socially valuable activities. Whistleblowing platforms like SecureDrop use onion services to allow sources to submit sensitive information to journalists without revealing their identity, facilitating accountability journalism that exposes corruption and abuse of power. Human rights organizations use onion services to provide resources and communication channels for activists in authoritarian regimes where internet surveillance is pervasive. Privacy-conscious individuals use onion services to escape the surveillance capitalism model that dominates the surface web, exercising their fundamental right to privacy in an era of ubiquitous data collection.

However, the same technical features that enable these legitimate uses also facilitate criminal activity. Dark web marketplaces have historically sold illegal drugs, weapons, stolen data, and exploitative content. The anonymity provided by onion services makes law enforcement investigation significantly more difficult, creating a practical safe haven for criminal enterprises. The ethical question becomes whether the legitimate uses justify tolerating the criminal misuse, or whether the harms outweigh the benefits.

Applying utilitarian analysis, the answer depends on empirical assessment of relative harms and benefits. If dark web hosting primarily facilitates criminal activity that causes substantial harm, while legitimate uses could be served through alternative means, then restricting or eliminating such hosting might maximize overall welfare. Conversely, if dark web hosting provides irreplaceable benefits for vulnerable populations—such as dissidents in authoritarian regimes who have no alternative means of secure communication—then preserving these capabilities might justify tolerating some level of criminal misuse, particularly if law enforcement can develop targeted approaches to combat specific criminal activities without dismantling the entire infrastructure.

From a rights-based perspective, the ethical analysis centers on competing claims. Individuals have a fundamental right to privacy and freedom of expression, which dark web hosting helps protect. However, victims of crimes facilitated by dark web anonymity also have rights to security and justice. Balancing these competing rights requires careful consideration of proportionality, necessity, and the availability of alternative means to achieve legitimate objectives.

Conclusion

The ethical landscape of the dark web defies simplistic characterization as either purely beneficial or entirely harmful. Specific cases of criminal data exploitation—including the AT&T, UnitedHealth Group, and National Public Data breaches—demonstrate the severe harms that dark web marketplaces enable, with billions of dollars in losses and hundreds of millions of victims. These crimes violate fundamental ethical principles across consequentialist, deontological, and virtue ethics frameworks.

Simultaneously, the technical capabilities that enable dark web hosting serve crucial functions for privacy protection, free expression, and resistance to censorship. The Tor network's sophisticated anonymity features provide irreplaceable tools for vulnerable populations, from journalists and whistleblowers to human rights activists and ordinary citizens seeking to escape surveillance capitalism.

The ethical path forward requires nuanced policy approaches that combat criminal exploitation while preserving legitimate privacy capabilities. This includes strengthening organizational cybersecurity to prevent data breaches at the source, developing targeted law enforcement techniques that identify specific criminal actors without compromising the anonymity of legitimate users, and fostering international cooperation to address the transnational nature of dark web crime. As Tritle (2021) concludes, "the question we must address is whether or not it would be ethical to dismantle the dark web as we know it"—a question that demands ongoing dialogue between technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and civil society to navigate the complex tensions between privacy, security, and justice in the digital age.
