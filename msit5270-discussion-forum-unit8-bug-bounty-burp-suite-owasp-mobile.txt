Discussion Forum Unit 8: Bug Bounty Platforms, Burp Suite, and OWASP Mobile Security

Bug Hunting in Healthcare Applications: A Practical Exploration

Introduction

Bug bounty programs have revolutionized cybersecurity by enabling ethical hackers to identify and report vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them (HackerOne, 2025). This discussion explores my experience researching vulnerabilities in healthcare applications, installing and configuring Burp Suite for security testing, and analyzing the OWASP Mobile Top 10 threats that pose significant risks to mobile applications in the healthcare sector.

Website Research and Bug Hunting: HackerOne Healthcare Programs

For this assignment, I explored HackerOne's bug bounty platform, specifically focusing on healthcare-related programs. HackerOne hosts numerous healthcare organizations seeking to identify vulnerabilities in their systems that could compromise protected health information (PHI), personally identifying information (PII), and financial data (HackerOne, 2025). The platform is particularly relevant to my role as a Healthcare IT Security Analyst, as data breaches in healthcare average $10.93 million—nearly 2.5 times the average across other industries (HackerOne, 2025).

During my research, I examined a healthcare portal's authentication mechanism and identified several potential areas of concern that would warrant further investigation in a legitimate bug bounty context:

1. **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**: Patient record URLs contained sequential identifiers that could potentially be manipulated to access other patients' records without proper authorization checks.

2. **Weak Session Management**: Session tokens appeared to have insufficient entropy and lacked proper expiration mechanisms, potentially allowing session hijacking attacks.

3. **Missing Security Headers**: The application lacked critical security headers such as Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options, making it vulnerable to clickjacking and cross-site scripting attacks.

According to HackerOne's 2024/2025 reports, authorization flaws such as improper access control and IDOR are experiencing significant increases in reports, while traditional vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection are declining (HackerOne, 2025). This trend aligns with my observations and highlights the evolving nature of web application security threats.

Burp Suite Installation and Configuration Experience

Installing Burp Suite Community Edition proved to be a straightforward yet educational process. I downloaded the latest version (2025.3) from PortSwigger's official website and followed the installation wizard on my Windows 11 workstation (PortSwigger, 2025). The installation process involved several key steps that are documented in the accompanying screenshots.

**Installation Process:**
1. Downloaded the Windows installer from portswigger.net (see Figure 1)
2. Executed the installer with administrator privileges
3. Accepted default installation paths and created start menu shortcuts
4. Launched Burp Suite and accepted the terms and conditions

**Initial Configuration:**
Upon first launch, I selected "Temporary Project" and "Burp defaults" for the project configuration (PortSwigger, 2025) as shown in Figure 2. The most critical configuration step involved setting up the proxy listener and configuring my browser to route traffic through Burp's proxy at 127.0.0.1:8080. Figure 3 displays the comprehensive learning resources available within Burp Suite's "Learn" tab, which proved invaluable during the setup process.

**Certificate Installation Challenge:**
The most challenging aspect was installing Burp's CA certificate to intercept HTTPS traffic. As illustrated in Figure 4, I followed the PortSwigger documentation for "Intercepting HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy." I navigated to http://burp while the proxy was active, downloaded the certificate, and added it to my browser's trusted certificate store. This step is essential for analyzing encrypted traffic without triggering security warnings (OrcaCore, 2025). Figure 5 shows the Burp Suite Proxy Intercept interface with the "Intercept is on" status, demonstrating that the tool was successfully configured to capture and hold HTTP/HTTPS traffic for analysis.

**Practical Testing Experience:**
Once configured, I conducted practical testing on the PortSwigger website itself. Figure 6 shows the PortSwigger homepage displaying new Burp AI features, including "Burp AI comes to Repeater" and "Build your own Repeater feature, now with AI" (PortSwigger, 2025). During testing, I encountered the expected browser security warning (Figure 7) when accessing sites without proper certificate configuration, which reinforced the importance of proper CA certificate installation.

Figure 8 demonstrates the Burp Suite Proxy Intercept tab with a captured GET request to portswigger.net, showing the complete HTTP request headers including User-Agent, Accept-Language, and other critical information. The HTTP History tab (Figure 9) displays multiple intercepted requests with detailed information including status codes, content lengths, MIME types, IP addresses, and timestamps—all essential data for comprehensive security analysis.

Figure 10 provides a detailed view of the HTTP History with both Request and Response panels visible at the bottom, along with the Inspector panel on the right showing request attributes, headers, and response headers. This comprehensive interface enables thorough analysis of web application behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

**Professional Application:**
In my healthcare IT security role, Burp Suite has become an invaluable tool for conducting security assessments of web applications that handle PHI (PortSwigger, 2025). The ability to intercept, analyze, and modify HTTP/HTTPS requests enables comprehensive security testing that identifies vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by threat actors.

OWASP Mobile Top 10: Common Threats to Mobile Applications

The OWASP Mobile Top 10 2024 provides a comprehensive framework for understanding mobile application security risks (OWASP Foundation, 2024). Three critical threats are particularly relevant to healthcare mobile applications:

**M3: Insecure Authentication/Authorization**
This vulnerability addresses risks related to device-specific input limitations, variable internet connections, and improper access controls (Indusface, 2024). In healthcare mobile applications, weak authentication mechanisms can allow attackers to bypass authentication or impersonate legitimate users, potentially accessing sensitive patient data. Prevention strategies include performing authentication server-side, using device-specific revocable tokens, and reinforcing server-side authorization controls (Security Boulevard, 2024). Authentication vulnerabilities are among the most expensive issues for IT professionals to resolve, making proactive prevention essential.

**M9: Insecure Data Storage**
Insecure data storage encompasses security weaknesses such as weak or absent encryption, data stored in easily accessible locations, insufficient access controls, and lack of secure transmission protocols (OWASP Foundation, 2024). Research indicates that as many as 76% of mobile apps may have insecure data storage vulnerabilities, putting applications and user data at significant risk (Promon, 2024). In healthcare contexts, this vulnerability is particularly concerning as it could lead to HIPAA violations and compromise patient confidentiality.

**M1: Improper Platform Usage**
This category includes misuse of platform features or failure to use platform security controls, such as improper use of TouchID, Keychain, or Android permissions (Indusface, 2024). Healthcare applications must properly implement platform-specific security features to protect sensitive data and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Healthcare-Specific Implications:**
The 2025 HIPAA Security Rule updates mandate that all covered entities and business associates conduct penetration testing at least annually and vulnerability scanning every six months (Beagle Security, 2025). This regulatory requirement underscores the importance of understanding and mitigating OWASP Mobile Top 10 vulnerabilities in healthcare mobile applications.

Conclusion

This exploration of bug bounty platforms, Burp Suite installation, and OWASP Mobile Top 10 threats has reinforced the critical importance of proactive security testing in healthcare environments (Beagle Security, 2025). The combination of ethical hacking through bug bounty programs, comprehensive security testing tools like Burp Suite, and frameworks like OWASP Mobile Top 10 provides a robust approach to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities before they can be exploited (HackerOne, 2025; PortSwigger, 2025; OWASP Foundation, 2024). The hands-on experience documented in the accompanying screenshots demonstrates practical application of these concepts and tools in real-world security testing scenarios. As healthcare organizations increasingly rely on web and mobile applications to deliver patient care, the skills and knowledge gained through bug hunting and security testing become essential for protecting sensitive health information and maintaining regulatory compliance (Beagle Security, 2025).
